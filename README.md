# Employee Tracker

This project is to demonstrate the usefulness of content management systems. I am using node, inquierer, and MySQL2. This command line app was created to manage and organize a companies departments, employees, and their respective roles within the company. The menu is interactive and easily changable to suit any given companies' needs.
